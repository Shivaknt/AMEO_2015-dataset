Step - 1 - Introduction -&gt; Give a detailed data description and objective

Step - 2 - Import the data and display the head, shape and description of the data.

Step - 3 - Univariate Analysis -&gt; PDF, Histograms, Boxplots, Countplots, etc..
- Find the outliers in each numerical column
- Understand the probability and frequency distribution of each numerical column
- Understand the frequency distribution of each categorical Variable/Column
- Mention observations after each plot.

Step - 4 - Bivariate Analysis
- Discover the relationships between numerical columns using Scatter plots, hexbin plots,
pair plots, etc..
- Identify the patterns between categorical and numerical columns using swarmplot,
boxplot, barplot, etc..
- Mention observations after each plot.

Step - 5 - Research Questions
- Times of India article dated Jan 18, 2019 states that “After doing your Computer Science
Engineering if you take up jobs as a Programming Analyst, Software Engineer,
Hardware Engineer and Associate Engineer you can earn up to 2.5-3 lakhs as a fresh
graduate.” Test this claim with the data given to you.
- Is there a relationship between gender and specialisation? (i.e. Does the preference of
Specialisation depend on the Gender?)
Step - 6 - Conclusion

Step - 7 - (Bonus) Come up with some interesting conclusions or research questions.
NOTE: Mention observations after each plot.

Step - 7 - Perform feature transformation:

- For Numerical Features -&gt; Do Column Standardization
- For Categorical -&gt; if more than 2 categories, use dummy variables. Otherwise
convert the feature to Binary.
